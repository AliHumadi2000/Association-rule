# Association-rule
### Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness.
### Association Rules find all sets of items (itemsets) that have support greater than the minimum support and then using the large itemsets to generate the desired rules that have confidence greater than the minimum confidence. The lift of a rule is the ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent. A typical and widely used example of association rules application is market basket analysis.
